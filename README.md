# Discord-Scorebot

This was made and hosted using Replit, and as such uses some features included there for variable/secret storage, etc. Scorebot was built to work with a specific other bot called Spellbot on one particular server, and as such makes references to roles for admin access, and other embeds that may look strange when viewed alone.
